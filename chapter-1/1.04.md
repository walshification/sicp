Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators
are compound expressions. Use this obsevation to describe the behavior of the
following procedure:

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```scheme

Given two numbers `a` and `b`, if `b` is greater than 0, `b` is added to `a`.
If `b` is less than 0 (that is, negative), `b` is subtracted from `a`, giving
the effect that the absolute value of `b` is compounded onto the value of `a`.
