# Exercise 1.5

## Question

Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced
with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines
the following two procedures:

```scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-
order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the
special form `if` is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result
determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

## Answer

Given applicative-order evaluation:

1. The interpreter attempts to evaluate the arguments to `test`.
2. `0` is evaluated as the first argument.
3. `p` is called, which begins a neverending recursive loop.
4. This results in `;Aborting!: maximum recursion depth exceeded`.

Given normal-order evalution:

1. The expression evaluates step-by-step.
2. `0` is found to be equal to `0`.
3. The then-clause `0` is returned.
4. `p` is never evaluated.
