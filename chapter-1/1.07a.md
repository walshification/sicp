# Exercise 1.7 Part 1

## Question

The `good-enough?` test used in computing square roots will not be very
effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real
computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited
precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these
statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large
numbers.

## Answer

Original

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
```

Dropping the calculation below the stated `good-enough?` threshold yields
results of ever-increasingly inaccuracy. For instance:

```scheme
1 ]=> (sqrt 0.001)

;Value: .04124542607499115

; Real value = 0.0316227766
```

This is because the even this significant error (from the standpoint of the
percentage difference between the true answer and our "good enough" threshold
is well below what we consider good enough.

On the other end of the spectrum, passing 10^12 produces no result because the
function enters an infinite recursion.

```scheme
1 ]=> (sqrt 1000000000000)

;Value: 1000000.

1 ]=> (sqrt 10000000000000)
; Infinite recursion.
^C
```

This illustrates the opposite problem. Our best guess that that end is
4472135.954999579, not nearly accurate enough for our `good-enough?` test, but
we are unable to improve our guess given the limits of floating-point
calculations.
