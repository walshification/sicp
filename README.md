# SICP: The Exercises

## Installing Scheme

The book uses [MIT/GNU Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) so that's what I used for the exercises.

### Apple Silicon (M1 Mac)

Kenneth Friedman wrote a simple [step-by-step guide](https://www.kennethfriedman.org/thoughts/2021/mit-scheme-on-apple-silicon/) for installing `mit-scheme` on Apple Silicon. Worked like a charm for me!

### Non-M1 Macs

`brew install mit-scheme`
